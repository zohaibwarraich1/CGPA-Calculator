This project is a C++ application designed to calculate the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) for students based on their exam results. It allows users to input course grades and credits, then computes the total grade points, semester GPA, and overall CGPA. The program is structured using multiple classes to manage courses, grades, and the calculation logic, ensuring accurate and efficient computation of academic performance.
